# Workspaces Images
This repository contains several example of desktop and application Workspaces images.
Administrators may leverage these images directly or use them as a starting point for their own custom images.
Each of these images is based off one of the [**Workspaces Core Images**](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-core-images?utm_campaign=Github&utm_source=github) which contain the necessary wiring to work within the Kasm Workspaces platform.


For more information about building custom images please review the  [**How To Guide**](https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/how_to/building_images.html?utm_campaign=Github&utm_source=github)

The Kasm team publishes applications and desktop images for use inside the platform. More information, including source can be found in the [**Default Images List**](https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/guide/custom_images.html?utm_campaign=Github&utm_source=github)
